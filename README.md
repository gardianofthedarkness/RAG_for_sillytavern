# RAG Memory Plugin for SillyTavern (🚀 In Development)

This is an **independent open-source plugin** for [SillyTavern](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern).  
We are actively developing this **RAG-powered memory system**, which integrates a **Qdrant vector database** for long-term conversational memory.

## 🚧 Project Status
- **This is NOT an official SillyTavern feature** but an external plugin.
- The plugin is in **active development**.
- All contributions and feedback are welcome!

## 📌 Features Under Development
- ✅ **Docker-based Qdrant initialization**
- 🔄 **OpenAI embedding API integration**
- 🗂️ **Vector search for contextual memory retrieval**
- 🎭 **Roleplaying character memory persistence**

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This repository is **not affiliated with the official SillyTavern developers**.  
It is an **independent experimental plugin** that extends SillyTavern with **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) memory capabilities**.
